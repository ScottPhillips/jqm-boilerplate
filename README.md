** THIS IS STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS **

I've found myself doing a number of WordPress themes that have been mobile-enabled, so I wanted to pull together a basic collection of boilerplate code that can be used to quickly pull together a mobile theme. This set of files uses the jQuery Mobile library and defines basic gestures for navigation (swiperight = back, swipedown = home).

Please don;t consider this a final theme to use. It should serve as a demonstration of some of the capabilities of jQuery Mobile as applied to WordPress, and provide the basic semantic structure for a jQm-powered theme.
